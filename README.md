## Description

> Ever need to decide the outcome of your level 5 halfling thief's pickpocket attempt against the level 7 half-elf mage
> who's holding onto that relic of Mmngutha'lga Zhahd at the top of The Tower of Twisting Fates?  Yes, this is THAT 
> kind of dice roller.

> If the above is not relevant to you, just move along, there's nothing for you here.  However, if you've had need of a
> reliable way to determine whether or not your barbarian landed a glancing blow or a legit hit against an orc without
> having to whip out your dice bag, then this is definitely the tool for you.
